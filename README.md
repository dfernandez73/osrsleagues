# osrsleagues
Once a year, a new event occurs in the game Old School RuneScape, colloquially known as "Leagues." During these events, Jagex (the owners of RuneScape) open servers where everyone is reset and cannot trade with one another. These leagues last roughly three months and attract most of the player base. As a result, many players "dump" their tradeable items in the main game, as they do not need those items during the leagues. This causes significant market changes, with important items for PvM (Player vs. Monster)encounters becoming undervalued prior to the leagues and overvalued afterward.

This dataset will encompass the last three leagues: Trailblazer Reloaded, Shattered Relics, and Trailblazer. We will focus on items classified as "gear" and then follow up with items classified as "supplies." For gear, we will analyze items from all three combat styles: Melee, Ranged, and Mage.
